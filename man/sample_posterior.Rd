\arguments{
\item{edges}{Dataframe with a from and two column encoding edges between
string node ids (direction does not matter). A list containing both a
\code{nodes} and \code{edges} dataframe can be passed to avoid having to unpack a
list of nodes and edges to the arguments of the same name. This is helpful
for the included simulation functions such as
\code{\link{sim_sbm_network}}.}

\item{nodes}{Optional dataframe that links a node \code{id} to its \code{type}, for when model is polypartite.}

\item{n_sweeps}{Number of MCMC sweeps of all nodes (after burn-in)}

\item{n_chains}{How many seperate MCMC chains to start and run}

\item{burnin_sweeps}{How many sweeps to run before starting to record}

\item{return_sweep_info}{Return entropy and number of nodes changed for each
sweep (defaults to \code{TRUE})}

\item{starting_partition}{Algorithm to start each chain with? Current options
are \code{"agglomerative"} or \code{"random"}.}

\item{epsilon}{Parameter to inforce ergodicity of markov chain. Setting to
zero will remove ergodicity from model, setting high will make model moves
more random.}

\item{greedy}{If using agglomerative initialization should algorithm search
every possible merge?}

\item{n_checks_per_block}{If not using agglomerative initialization, how many
options for merging should be explored per block?}

\item{initialization_mcmc_steps}{If using agglomerative initialization, how
many steps of MCMC should be run after merging blocks to allow model to
find optimal layout in new block partition?}

\item{verbose}{Array of what info should be printed as model runs. Default
shows \code{"initialization"} info of model. Other options are \verb{"silent} to
print nothing, or \code{"iteration progress"} which prints out results of each
mcmc iteration as it happens.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to \code{\link{create_sbm}}}
