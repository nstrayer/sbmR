\title{Run a single MCMC sweep over nodes}
\usage{
mcmc_sweep(
  sbm,
  num_sweeps = 1,
  eps = 0.1,
  variable_num_blocks = TRUE,
  track_pairs = FALSE,
  level = 0,
  verbose = FALSE,
  return_sbm_network = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sbm}{\code{sbm_network} object as created by
\code{\link{new_sbm_network()}}.}

\item{num_sweeps}{Number of times all nodes are passed through for move
proposals.}

\item{eps}{Controls randomness of move proposals. Effects both the block
merging and mcmc sweeps.}

\item{variable_num_blocks}{Should the model allow new blocks to be created or
empty blocks removed while sweeping or should number of blocks remain
constant?}

\item{track_pairs}{Return a dataframe with all pairs of nodes along with the
number of sweeps they shared the same group?}

\item{level}{Level of nodes who's blocks will have their block membership run
through MCMC proposal-accept routine.}

\item{verbose}{If set to \code{TRUE} then each proposed move for all sweeps will
have information given on entropy delta, probability of moving, and if the
move were accepted printed to the console.}

\item{return_sbm_network}{Should the updated \code{sbm_network} object that was
provided to function be returned in the results under \code{sbm_network}? If set
to \code{FALSE} the new state after the sweep will not be maintained.}
}
\value{
List with two dataframes. The first telling for all sweeps everytime
a node was moved and what group it was moved to. The second telling for
each sweep the entropy delta and total number of nodes that were moved to
new groups in that sweep. If \code{track_pairs = TRUE}, then an additional
\code{pairing_counts} dataframe is added to output.
}
\description{
Runs a single Metropolis Hastings MCMC sweep across all nodes at specified
level (For algorithm details see
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10225}{Piexoto, 2018}). Each node is given a
chance to move blocks or stay in current block and all nodes are processed in
random order. Takes the level that the sweep should take place on (int) and
if new blocks blocks can be proposed and empty blocks removed (boolean).

# Start with a random network and assign randomly to 4 blocks
n_blocks <- 3

# Calculate entropy with random blocks

# Run 4 MCMC sweeps

# Look at the per-sweep level information
