\title{Builds a new sbm_network object from data}
\usage{
new_sbm_network(
  edges = dplyr::tibble(),
  nodes = NULL,
  edges_from_column = from,
  edges_to_column = to,
  bipartite_edges = FALSE,
  setup_model = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{Dataframe with a from and two column encoding edges between
string node ids (direction does not matter).}

\item{nodes}{Optional dataframe that links a node \code{id} to its \code{type}, for
when model is polypartite.}

\item{edges_from_column}{Name of the from column for edges}

\item{edges_to_column}{Name of the to column for edges}

\item{bipartite_edges}{Do the passed edges reflect a bipartite struture? I.e.
are nodes in from \code{from} column of a different type to those in the \code{to}
column?}

\item{setup_model}{Should an SBM model object be added? Set to \code{FALSE} if
network is just being visualized or described.}

\item{default_node_type}{What should nodes that the type is generated for be called?}

\item{show_warnings}{Do you want to be warned when minor problems are
detected by function? Usefull to disable when not running in an interactive
mode etc.}

\description{
Constructs an object with the \code{sbm_network} class. Takes as input at a
minumum an edge dataframe and will also accept a nodes dataframe that can
contain addition information about the nodes in the network. A helper for
allowing bipartite structure is provided which will treat either side of
passed edges dataframe as two different types of nodes.

\examples{

# Build small object from simple edge dataframe
small_edges <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~a_node, ~b_node,
  "a1"   , "b1"   ,
  "a1"   , "b2"   ,
  "a1"   , "b3"   ,
  "a2"   , "b1"   ,
  "a2"   , "b4"   ,
  "a3"   , "b1"
)

new_sbm_network(small_edges, edges_from_column = a_node, edges_to_column = b_node)

# Build larger object from a simulated dataset
network <- sim_basic_block_network(n_blocks = 3, n_nodes_per_block = 40)

new_sbm_network(edges = network$edges, nodes = network$nodes)
