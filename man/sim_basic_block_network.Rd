\usage{
sim_basic_block_network(
  n_groups = 2,
  n_nodes_per_group = 5,
  propensity_drawer = function(n) {     sample(seq(rbeta(1, 1, 5), rbeta(1, 5, 1),
    length.out = n)) },
  edge_dist = purrr::rbernoulli,
  allow_self_connections = FALSE,
  keep_connection_counts = FALSE,
  return_connection_propensities = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_groups}{How many groups to simulate}

\item{n_nodes_per_group}{How many nodes in each group}

\item{propensity_drawer}{Function that takes a single size argumenet and
returns a vector of connection propensities of specified size. Default
draws propensity from \code{n} evenly spaced values in the 0-1 range.}

\item{edge_dist}{A distribution function that has two inputs: the first is
number of samples to draw and the second the \code{propensity} value from
\code{connection_propensities}. For instance, the default value is \code{rpois} which
takes two arguments: \code{n} and \code{lambda}. In this scenario the \code{propensity} of
connections between two nodes is provided to \code{lambda} and thus is the
average number of connections for each pair of nodes between two given
groups.}

\item{allow_self_connections}{Should nodes be allowed to have connections to
themselves?}

\item{keep_connection_counts}{Should the connection counts stay on returned
edges? If edges distribution is a binary yes or no then you will likely
want to set this to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{return_connection_propensities}{If set to \code{TRUE} the returned list will
also include the simulated connection propensities dataframe. This can be
used for recreating draws using \code{\link{sim_sbm_network()}}.}
}
\value{
A list with a \code{nodes} dataframe (containing a node's \code{id} and \code{group}
membership), an \code{edges} dataframe (containing \code{from} and \code{to} nodes along
with the total number of \code{connections} as drawn from \code{edge_dist}), and if
\code{return_connection_propensities == TRUE}: \code{connection_propensities}
dataframe that shows the randomly drawn connection propensities between
groups.
}
\description{
Simulates a simple block structured network with a desired number of constant
sized groups. The probability of connections between given groups will be
drawn from a passed function that must return a numeric value that will be
used as the propensity parameter for drawing edge counts from a node pair.
The default values will draw propensity values for bernouli edges with an
average of a 50\% chance of connection.
