\usage{
sim_basic_block_network(
  n_groups = 2,
  n_nodes_per_group = 5,
  prob_of_connections_dist = function(n) rbeta(n = n, shape1 = 3.5, shape2 = 3.5),
  edge_dist = purrr::rbernoulli,
  allow_self_connections = FALSE,
  keep_connection_counts = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_groups}{How many groups to simulate}

\item{n_nodes_per_group}{How many nodes in each group}

\item{prob_of_connections_dist}{Function that takes a single size argumenet
and returns a vector of connection propensities of specified size. Default
is drawing Bernouli probabilities from a symmetric beta distribution
centered at 0.5}

\item{edge_dist}{A distribution function that has two inputs: the first is
number of samples to draw and the second the \code{propensity} value from
\code{connection_propensities}. For instance, the default value is \code{rpois} which
takes two arguments: \code{n} and \code{lambda}. In this scenario the \code{propensity} of
connections between two nodes is provided to \code{lambda} and thus is the
average number of connections for each pair of nodes between two given
groups.}

\item{allow_self_connections}{Should nodes be allowed to have connections to
themselves?}

\item{keep_connection_counts}{Should the connection counts stay on returned
edges? If edges distribution is a binary yes or no then you will likely
want to set this to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list with a \code{nodes} dataframe (containing a node's \code{id} and \code{group}
membership) and a \code{edges} dataframe (containing \code{from} and \code{to} nodes along
with the total number of \code{connections} as drawn from \code{edge_dist}.)
}
\description{
Simulates a simple block structured network with a desired number of constant
sized groups. The probability of connections between given groups will be
drawn from a passed function that must return a numeric value that will be
used as the propensity parameter for drawing edge counts from a node pair.
The default values will draw propensity values for bernouli edges with an
average of a 50\% chance of connection.
