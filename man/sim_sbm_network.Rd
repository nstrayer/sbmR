\usage{
sim_sbm_network(
  group_info,
  connection_propensities,
  edge_dist = rpois,
  allow_self_connections = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{group_info}{A dataframe/tibble with two columns: \code{group}: the id of the
group, and \code{n_nodes}: the number of nodes to simulate from that group.}

\item{connection_propensities}{A dataframe with 3 columns: \code{group_1}: the id
of the from group, \code{group_2}: the id of the to group, and \code{propensity}: the
parameter for \code{edge_dist} that controls if and or how many edges should
occur between the pair of groups on average.}

\item{edge_dist}{A distribution function that has two inputs: the first is
number of samples to draw and the second the \code{propensity} value from
\code{connection_propensities}. For instance, the default value is \code{rpois} which
takes two arguments: \code{n} and \code{lambda}. In this scenario the \code{propensity} of
connections between two nodes is provided to \code{lambda} and thus is the
average number of connections for each pair of nodes between two given
groups.}

\item{allow_self_connections}{Should nodes be allowed to have connections to
themselves? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with a \code{nodes} dataframe (containing a node's \code{id} and \code{group}
membership) and a \code{edges} dataframe (containing \code{from} and \code{to} nodes along
with the total number of \code{connections} as drawn from \code{edge_dist}.)
}
\description{
Simulates nodes and edges from a network where edge connections are derived
from the Stochastic Block Model. A dataframe describing the different groups
present and the number of nodes within them, a dataframe that provides the
\code{propensity} of connection between two edges, and a distribution function
who's main parameter the \code{propensity} value defines are needed.
