#' Run a single MCMC sweep over nodes
#'
#' Runs a single Metropolis Hastings MCMC sweep across all nodes at specified
#' level (For algorithm details see
#' \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10225}{Piexoto, 2018}). Each node is given a
#' chance to move blocks or stay in current block and all nodes are processed in
#' random order. Takes the level that the sweep should take place on (int) and
#' if new blocks blocks can be proposed and empty blocks removed (boolean).
#'
#' @inheritParams add_node
#' @inheritParams collapse_blocks
#' @param num_sweeps Number of times all nodes are passed through for move
#'   proposals.
#' @param level Level of nodes who's blocks will have their block membership run
#'   through MCMC proposal-accept routine.
#' @param variable_num_blocks Should the model allow new blocks to be created or
#'   empty blocks removed while sweeping or should number of blocks remain
#'   constant?
#' @param track_pairs Return a dataframe with all pairs of nodes along with the
#'   number of sweeps they shared the same group?
#' @param verbose If set to `TRUE` then each proposed move for all sweeps will
#'   have information given on entropy delta, probability of moving, and if the
#'   move were accepted printed to the console.
#' @param return_sbm_network Should the updated `sbm_network` object that was
#'   provided to function be returned in the results under `sbm_network`? If set
#'   to `FALSE` the new state after the sweep will not be maintained.
#'
#' @return List with two dataframes. The first telling for all sweeps everytime
#'   a node was moved and what group it was moved to. The second telling for
#'   each sweep the entropy delta and total number of nodes that were moved to
#'   new groups in that sweep. If `track_pairs = TRUE`, then an additional
#'   `pairing_counts` dataframe is added to output.
