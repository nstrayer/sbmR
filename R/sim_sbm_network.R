#' Simulate SBM Network
#'
#' Simulates nodes and edges from a network where edge connections are derived
#' from the Stochastic Block Model. A dataframe describing the different groups
#' present and the number of nodes within them, a dataframe that provides the
#' `propensity` of connection between two edges, and a distribution function
#' who's main parameter the `propensity` value defines are needed.
#'
#' @param group_info A dataframe/tibble with two columns: `group`: the id of the
#'   group, and `n_nodes`: the number of nodes to simulate from that group.
#' @param connection_propensities A dataframe with 3 columns: `group_1`: the id
#'   of the from group, `group_2`: the id of the to group, and `propensity`: the
#'   parameter for `edge_dist` that controls if and or how many edges should
#'   occur between the pair of groups on average.
#' @param edge_dist A distribution function that has two inputs: the first is
#'   number of samples to draw and the second the `propensity` value from
#'   `connection_propensities`. For instance, the default value is `rpois` which
#'   takes two arguments: `n` and `lambda`. In this scenario the `propensity` of
#'   connections between two nodes is provided to `lambda` and thus is the
#'   average number of connections for each pair of nodes between two given
#'   groups.
#' @param allow_self_connections Should nodes be allowed to have connections to
#'   themselves?
#' @param keep_connection_counts Should the connection counts stay on returned
#'   edges? If edges distribution is a binary yes or no then you will likely
#'   want to set this to `TRUE`.
#'
#' @return A list with a `nodes` dataframe (containing a node's `id` and `group`
#'   membership) and a `edges` dataframe (containing `from` and `to` nodes along
#'   with the total number of `connections` as drawn from `edge_dist`.)
