<p>One technique of finding the optimal number of clusters/ best partitioning is using the efficient agglomerative merging algorithm. This is typically used to find the initial state for MCMC chains but can stand on its own as a clustering method.</p>
<p>Agglomerative merging can be acomplished with the SBM class using the functions <code><a href="../reference/collapse_groups.html">collapse_groups()</a></code> and <code>collapse_runs()</code>. <code><a href="../reference/collapse_groups.html">collapse_groups()</a></code> runs a single agglomerative merge step from one group per node all the way down to your desired number of groups and <code>collapse_runs()</code> repeats this process for a range of groups.</p>
<p>Before we look at using both we need to setup some data to cluster.</p>
<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#setup" class="anchor"></a>Setup</h2>
<p>First we load the <code>sbmR</code> package along with the <code>tidyverse</code> package.</p>

<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#data" class="anchor"></a>Data</h3>
<p>The data we are using will come from the included simulation function, <code><a href="../reference/sim_basic_block_network.html">sim_basic_block_network()</a></code>.</p>

<p>We can investigate the simulated network’s true block structure by visualizing the connection propensities between the groups.</p>

<code>sigma</code>: Controls the rate of collapse. At each step of the collapsing the model will try and remove <code>current_num_nodes(1 - 1/sigma)</code> nodes from the model. So a larger sigma means a faster collapse rate.</li>
<li>
<code>desired_num_groups</code>: How many groups should this given merge drop down to. If the network has more than one node type this number is multiplied by the total number of types.</li>
<li>
<code>report_all_steps</code>: Should the model state be provided for every merge step or just the final one? If collapsing is being used to infer hierarcichal structure in data or inspection is desired this should be set to <code>TRUE</code>, otherwise it will slow down collapsing due to increased data transfer.</li>
<li>
<code>greedy</code>: Should every possible group merger be considered? If <code>FALSE</code>, candidates for mergers are drawn by similarity in connections (just as MCMC move proposals are). This may lead the model to local minimums by always pursuing best possible merges.</li>
<li>
<code>num_group_proposals</code>: If <code>greedy = FALSE</code>, this parameter controls how many merger proposals are drawn for each group in the model. A larger number will increase the exploration of merge potentials but may lead the model to local minimums for the same reason greedy mode does.</li>
<li>
<code>num_mcmc_sweeps</code>: How many MCMC sweeps the model does at each agglomerative merge step. This allows the model to allow nodes to find their most natural resting place in a given collapsed state. Larger values will slow down runtime but can potentially lead for more stable results.</li>
<li>
<code>beta</code>: Inverse temperature parameter impacting the acceptance probabilities of MCMC sweeps. A higher value means model puts more weight on accepting moves that improve model fit. Only matters if <code>num_mcmc_sweeps &gt; 0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="role-of-sigma" class="section level3">

<a href="#role-of-sigma" class="anchor"></a>Role of sigma…</h3>
<p>The most important parameter from above is <code>sigma</code>. This controls the rate the model is collapsed. A slower (and lower) value will allow the model to explore more intermediate steps and make less drastic jumps between.</p>
<p>We can see how <code>sigma</code> effects the speed of the collapse by looking at the total number of steps needed to fully collapse a network down to one remaining group by the total number of nodes in the network.</p>
<p><img src="agglomerative_merging_files/figure-html/steps_needed_to_collapse-1.png" width="576"></p>
<p>We can see that at <code>sigma &gt; 2</code> the algorithm takes very few steps to collapse the network even as the network gets large.</p>
<p>If we pin the network size at a constant (here 150) we can see the path of collapsing in terms of groups remaining for a variety of sigmas…</p>

<p>Again we see that the model drops very quickly at values of <code>sigma &gt; 2</code>.</p>
<p>We can see that with larger sigma values we get very rapid convergence to our desired model size. In theory this could cause issues like follows:</p>
<p>There are four groups in model (<code>{a,b,c,d}</code>). Groups <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> may be close to eachother and group <code>c</code> may be closer to <code>b</code> than it is do <code>d</code>. If we force two merges in a given step, <code>a</code>, and <code>b</code>, may be merged together and then, because those groups are merged and <code>c</code> is now left to merge with only <code>d</code>, which it does, forgoing the more optimal merging of <code>a-&gt;b-&gt;c</code>, <code>d</code>. In practive however, this scenario tends to not be an issue.</p>
<p>If you want to merge groups together one at a time, specifying <code>sigma &lt;= 1</code> will force that to happen. This can be combined with <code>num_mcmc_sweeps = 0</code> to give you a dendrogram-compatable collapse of your network.</p>

<p>We see a nice smooth line going from one group per node down to a single group for all nodes. This line will always be monotonic increasing as the number of groups goes down. This is because removing more groups <em>always</em> result in a poorer model fit because less information is being provided by the model structure.</p>

<p>So interestingly we see that while the runtime was way faster, our path had almost the same entropy values, which got closer as the model collapsed further. This shows that, if you’re looking for the best collapse value increasing your sigma can save you lots of time without sacraficing much in the way of model performance.</p>

<div id="collapse-runs" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#collapse-runs" class="anchor"></a>Collapse Runs</h2>
<p>So far we have looked at a single run of agglomerative collapsing, but the recomended algorithm in the paper the algorithm was introduced in, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4378">Piexoto 2014</a>, recomends running a seperate collapse for each number of groups, going from one up to a reasonable stopping point.</p>
<p>Interestingly, due to the speed advantages of the high sigma values, even running seperate collapses for each target group number can be very fast compared to a single merge that looks at the possible group values.</p>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/collapse_run.html">collapse_run()</a></code> performs multiple merge runs to different numbers of groups and returns the results of the final merge collapsed together in the same form <code><a href="../reference/collapse_groups.html">collapse_groups()</a></code> does with <code>report_all_steps = TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>The only arguments it has that <code><a href="../reference/collapse_groups.html">collapse_groups()</a></code> does not are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>start_group_num</code>: Lowest number of groups to reduce to</li>
<li>
<code>end_group_num</code>: Highest number of groups to reduce to</li>
<li>
<code>parallel</code>: Should algorithm be run in parallel to speed up?</li>
</ul>
<p>The parallel argument is particularly valuable as it exploits the fact that each run is independent of eachother and thus can be run on seperate threads for significant speedups.</p>
<p>Lets try it on our model scanning from 1-10 groups.</p>

<p>We see that for the overlaping portion we get better performance than the single group run and a high resolution as well.</p>
<p>One other property of this run result is it seems smoother than the single <code><a href="../reference/collapse_groups.html">collapse_groups()</a></code> result. This fact can be exploited to find the best partitioning.</p>

<p>Finding the “elbow” in graphs for choosing cluster results is an imperfect science. One method that works well for SBM models is looking at a given collapse results difference from the rolling mean of the entropy. Doing this serves to show what points show larger than expected dips in entropy for a single group being added.</p>
<p>The included function <code><a href="../reference/visualize_collapse_results.html">visualize_collapse_results()</a></code> lets you look at this metric for a given collapse run. Here we try it on our previous run.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb15-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/visualize_collapse_results.html">visualize_collapse_results</a></span>(run_results)</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="agglomerative_merging_files/figure-html/visualizing_run-results-1.png" width="576"></p>
<p>The “best” point intuitively would be the point with the highest peak on the top chart. Here we see that peak occurs at <strong>3</strong> groups. Which we know to be the true number of groups in this network (because we simulated it).</p>
<p>The nice thing about this metric is that it can be used in real time as we scan up the number of groups meaning the algorithm can stop at the value it needs by detecting a decline in the deviance function.</p>

<p>So far we have ignored the column <code>state</code> in our collapse results. This column is a list of dataframes, each containing the state of the model at a given collapse. This can be used to return the model to the state for the best group partitioning.</p>
<p>This can be done with the <code><a href="../reference/load_from_state.html">load_from_state()</a></code> function after retrieving the chosen state (e.g. <code>my_sbm %&gt;% load_from_state(results$state[5])</code>) but a helper function is included to automate this process. <code><a href="../reference/choose_best_collapse_state.html">choose_best_collapse_state()</a></code> takes as input the dataframe returned by <code><a href="../reference/collapse_run.html">collapse_run()</a></code> (or <code>collapse_group(report_all_steps = TRUE)</code>) and the method of choosing the ‘best’ fit and selects the best result and loads it into the model.</p>
<p>We can demonstrate with our collapse run results:</p>
